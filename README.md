# Dashboards

Download the yaml file, open Dataloop and import the file on the Dashboards page. You will get a new dashboard in Dataloop that matches the title: set in the file.

The import and export buttons are in the top right corner next to the 'add widget' button.

Feel free to submit pull requests to share cool dashboards for services you've created.

Also, check the tags set on the widgets in the yaml file. You may need to do a find and replace on them to match the tags you are using to group your metrics.
